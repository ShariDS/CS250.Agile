System Development Life Cycle
•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
# For interpreting user stories, I would collect user stories from the product owner, collaborate with the team, and create more specific specifications and testing requirements. User stories all us to understand what the project is and what is the projects function. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
# For developing programs, my approach would depend on the project. If the project is very straightforward and doesn’t have any questionable variabilities, then I would adapt a waterfall approach. If the project is some uncertain requirements, then I would adapt an agile approach in which the project would be handled in iterations that have a budget and timeline that is tentative upon issues that are expected to arise. A key aspect of agile is that user stories can be prioritized, so that if there is a tight schedule, the project can be scaled accordingly. 

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
# A good team member follows the values of scrum. A good team member is transparent about problems and communicates often. A good team member helps create an environment of encouragement and safety within the team, to the affect that everyone on the team feels safe to make mistakes and be transparent. A good team member is always finding ways to work on personal and professional growth through introspection and skill development. A good team member understands and aligns with the vision and goals of the team. A good team member takes responsibility for their own attitude and energy is uplifting to the team.
